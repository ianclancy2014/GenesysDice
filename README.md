# GenesysDice
Dice roller for the Genesys TTRPG system

Description:
The GenesysDice.js file is the file that will be the dice handler for my various Genesys RPG projects. I'm going to touch it up and refine it, but I'm not going to add anything to it that will be specific to any one project because I plan on pulling from it for other projects and fine tuning it when I use it in each project.
